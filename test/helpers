    #      that has actually been installed by the buildpack.
    #      PHP version numbers follow the semver standard (i.e.
    #      `maj.min.patch`).
    #      Consequently, to test that PHP 8 is installed, one must set this
    #      variable value to `8.` (notice the ending `.`) to make sure the test
    #      fails if any other version starting with a `8` is installed (for
    #      example, PHP `80.1.0`).
    #      The logic is the same with minor version: to test that PHP 8.2 is
    #      installed, set this variable to `8.2.` to make sure the test fails
    #      if PHP 8.20.1 is installed, for example.
    #      To test a full version, please add a trailing space, i.e. `8.1.15␣`,
    #      so that `8.1.156` doesn't make the test pass.
