### Helpers functions

test::helpers::test_deploy() {
    # Deploys a PHP app step by step and tests that everything is working as
    # expected.
    # To do so, this function runs the buildpack scripts and mimicks the
    # platform behavior wherever needed.
    # The different fixtures allow us to test different setup and conditions.
    #
    # Globals:
    #   STD_OUT
    #   default_modules

    # Arguments:
    #   $1 > $detect_expectation
    #      See `test::helpers::test_detect`.
    #
    #   $2 > $version
    #      See `test::helpers::test_compile`.

    #
    # Arguments:
    #   $1 > $expected_output
    #      The value of this variable must equal the actual output of the
    #      `bin/detect` script for the assertion to pass.

    # Runs the `bin/compile` script of the buildpack and then:
    # - Asserts that is succeeded
    # - Asserts that the version of installed PHP is the one expected
    #
    # Arguments:
    #   $1 > $version: Expected version of PHP.
    #      The value of this variable is compared to the version of PHP
    #      that has actually been installed by the buildpack.
    #      PHP version numbers follow the semver standard (i.e.
    #      `maj.min.patch`).
    #      Consequently, to test that PHP 8 is installed, one must set this
    #      variable value to `8.` (notice the ending `.`) to make sure the test
    #      fails if any other version starting with a `8` is installed (for
    #      example, PHP `80.1.0`).
    #      The logic is the same with minor version: to test that PHP 8.2 is
    #      installed, set this variable to `8.2.` to make sure the test fails
    #      if PHP 8.20.1 is installed, for example.
    #      To test a full version, please add a trailing space, i.e. `8.1.15␣`,
    #      so that `8.1.156` doesn't make the test pass.

    # - Working directory is set to $HOME

    # This environment is automatically reverted back, thanks to the `tearDown`
    # function override in `test/run`.

    # we can't because the switch of environment should only happen **during**
    # the test (after several steps have been reached), not before.

    # /!\ This function is meant to be called after a successful call to
    #     to `test::utils::compile` to further test the result of the
    #     bin/compile call. It makes no sense to call it in another context.
